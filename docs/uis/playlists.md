# Playlists

Playlists are dynamically generated from Higher Key folders. Any highlight tagged with a specific Higher Key or its descendants is part of that Higher Key's playable sequence.

## Accessing Playlists

- **Higher Key Manager (`P`)**: Open the Higher Key manager.
- **Select Key**: Choose a Higher Key folder.
- **Play Sequence**: The system automatically aggregates all highlights within that folder (recursive) to form a playable sequence.
