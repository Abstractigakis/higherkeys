# Market & Product Strategy

## Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### 1. The "High-Output" Intellectual / Investor

* **Profile**: Deeply curious, consumes 10+ hours of video/podcasts weekly.
* **Pain Point**: "I watched a 2-hour lecture but can't find that one 30-second gem when making a decision."
* **Usage**: Building a "Tree of Wisdom" to rapidly test new ideas against historical data.

### 2. The "Skill-Based" Practitioner (e.g., Rock Climber, Athlete, Artist)

* **Profile**: Uses video to study form, technique, and strategy.
* **Pain Point**: Needs to bridge the gap between "Learning" (at home on a screen) and "Applying" (at the gym/field).
* **Usage**: Utilizing GPS-anchored "Ornaments" to trigger state-dependent learning while at the specific physical location of practice.

### 3. The Modern Researcher / PhD Student

* **Profile**: Dealing with massive qualitative data sets.
* **Pain Point**: Traditional folder structures and bookmarks are too rigid for cross-disciplinary insights.
* **Usage**: Effortless hierarchical labeling to place a single clip into multiple namespaces (e.g., #neuroscience/memory/encoding and #psychology/learning/theories).

## Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

### Phase 1: The "Curation" Hook (Months 1-3)

* **Tactics**: Partner with "Curator" influencers on X and YouTube who already share "Top 10 Insights" from long-form content.
* **Deliverable**: Public "Higher Keys Playlists" that users can fork.
* **Goal**: Demonstrate the value of "Bumblebee Playlists" (the remix).

### Phase 2: Community "Nodes" (Months 3-6)

* **Tactics**: Launch a "Shared Root" feature where communities (e.g., a specific investing group or climbing gym) can contribute to a collective Higher Key tree.
* **Messaging**: "The Library of Alexandria for your specific niche."

### Phase 3: Hardware Integration (Months 6+)

* **Tactics**: Early-adopter beta for AR glasses (Vision Pro / Quest) to overlay "Ornaments" onto physical space via GPS.
