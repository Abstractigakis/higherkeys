# Higher Keys Branding & Style Guide

## Visual Identity: The "Cognitive Exoskeleton"

The brand should feel like a bridge between **Ancient Memory Palaces** and **Neural-Symphony Future**. It is both organic (The Tree) and structured (The Keys).

### 1. The Core Metaphor: The Christmas Tree

* **The Tree**: The skeletal structure of the user's knowledge (Hierarchical labels). It should be dark, minimal, and structural.
* **The Ornaments**: The "Clips" and "Memories". These are vibrant, high-contrast, AI-generated abstract artworks. They should "pop" against the dark background.
* **The Glow**: Ornaments slated for review (SRS) should have a subtle pulsing "aura" or glow, drawing the user's eye.

### 2. Design Pillars

* **Brutal Snappiness**: No "bouncy" animations. Transitions should be instant or sub-100ms. The UI responds to the keyboard at the speed of thought.
* **Legend-Driven Interface**: Every view includes a small "Legend" in the corner (e.g., `[J] Down [K] Up [/] Search`). This reinforces the keyboard-first workflow as part of the brand.
* **Abstract Mnemonics**: Use a specific "Higher Keys" style for AI generation—recommend "Abstract Surrealism" or "Geometric Expressionism". Avoid literal thumbnails; focus on color and form to trigger the *Von Restorff Effect*.

### 3. Color Palette

| Element | Color | Mood |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Background** | Deep Space Black (#0A0A0A) | Focus, Depth |
| **Structure** | Slate Grey / Obsidian (#1F2937) | Organization, Stability |
| **Accent (Action)** | Neon Cyan (#00F2FF) | Speed, Future |
| **Accent (Memory)** | Ethereal Violet (#A855F7) | Consciousness, Art |
| **Accent (Utility)** | Amber (#F59E0B) | GPS, Real-world action |

### 4. Typography

* **Headings**: A sharp, high-contrast Serif (e.g., *Playfair Display* or *Cormorant Garamond*) to evoke "The Great Library" feel.
* **Body / UI**: A monospaced or highly legible sans-serif (e.g., *JetBrains Mono* or *Inter*) to evoke technical precision and keyboard-readiness.

## Key Visual Elements to Build

1. **The "Bumblebee" Logo**: A stylized transformer-esque bee that represents "The Remix"—stitching together radio clips (information fragments) into a new message.
2. **The Coordinate Stamp**: A visual signature for every memory that includes `[LAT/LONG / TIMESTAMP]`, styled like a military or laboratory readout.
3. **The "Key" Icon**: A hierarchical symbol (e.g., `# / # / #`) that glows when active.
